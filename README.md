# Facial Recognition based Teperature Check (FRTC)

### Introduction:
This repository contains the software and the training files for a system that measures your body temperature, and stores the data based on identification by facial recognition. This system uses a Raspberry Pi 4 as the base, an MLX90614 as the temperature sensor and a NoIR V1.2 Camera for the recognition.

The faces uses are:
- mine (Adi)
- Aiyana's
- Kai's

Therefore, 3 different faces.

This system will follow tutorials from PyImageSearch for facial recognition.
Specifically, [this one](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/24/opencv-face-recognition/).
